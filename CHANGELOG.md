# Change Log

## [0.x] - 2026-xx-XX

## Added

- Devices
  - Support the hongyavision HYWS-SGT0204S (PCB marking `2G5F4_10G2_V1.01`), an
    RTL8372 based 4x2.5G + 2xSFP+ unmanaged switch with a 512 KB Bright Moon
    `T25S40` flash. It is a sibling of the KP-9000-6XH-X2 (2M-PCB43-V1.1) with
    the two SFP+ cages wired the other way round (physical 5 is on SDS1,
    physical 6 on SDS0), no reset button fitted, wrong silkscreen labels on the
    serial header, `LED_GLB_IO_EN` bit 6 has to be set for the port LEDs to
    work, and the fitted T25S40 cannot be read in DIO mode on this board, so the
    target selects single-IO flash reads (`flash_sio`). New machine target
    `MACHINE_2G5F4_10G2_V1_01`, see `doc/devices/2G5F4_10G2_V1.01.md`.

- Web UI
  - Compress the embedded assets (minify + gzip) and switch to a single-page layout. #315
  - Replace the multi-page UI with a themed single-page app: light, dark and Selenized themes following the browser by default,
    English, Japanese and Chinese, save to flash merges the command log into the startup config and verifies the write,
    firmware images are checked in the browser before upload. #429

## Changed

## Fixed

- LLDP
  - Format binary MAC-address Port IDs as 17 colon-separated hexadecimal characters instead
    of interpreting their six octets as text. Deliver LLDP before the shared STP/LACP
    multicast dispatch, including when STP or LACP is enabled.
  - Reject invalid ID lengths/subtypes, malformed MAC lengths and truncated TLVs without
    publishing a neighbor. The receive parser still does not enforce mandatory TLV order,
    TTL presence or End TLV presence.
  - Text fields already used bounded copies with an explicit trailing NUL; embedded NUL,
    controls, quotes and backslashes remain replaced by dots. The garbled binary Port ID
    was not a missing-terminator bug.
  - Port IDs retain at most 17 printable characters locally, not the IEEE wire maximum:
    identifiers contain 1..255 octets plus a subtype byte. Longer valid IDs are truncated.
    This branch accepts only six-octet MAC Chassis IDs; arbitrary Chassis ID storage and
    its separate display-capacity correction belong to the neighbor-details branch.

- Config
  - A startup configuration line longer than the command buffer no longer stops the replay:
    the offending line is skipped and the following lines are still applied.
  - The web UI and the configuration upload now refuse a line the replay cannot take,
    instead of writing it to flash.

## Breaking changes

- Config
  - VLAN don't accept port `u`-suffix anymore.
    So `vlan 1 4u` is not valid anymore.
    Replace it with `vlan 1 4`.
- Commands
  - port zero/`0` is treated as the `CPU_PORT`. #326
  - Many commands don't accept the CPU_PORT anymore. See #334.
    When the CPU_PORT is needed, the command/service will add the CPU_PORT automaticly.
    Only `isolate` accept the CPU_PORT as destination port.
